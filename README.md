# FlashCards

Try your luck at answering these JavaScript flashcard questions and see just how much of a JS genius you are. There are 30 questions. When you've answered all of them you'll be able to see your score. Goodluck and may the JS force be with you!

## Project Outline

In this project, I was required to write a program, simulating a set of flash cards through the command line! A user will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.
